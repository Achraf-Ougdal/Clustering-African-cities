# Clustering-African-cities
This project was developed as part of IBM’s Data Science Professional Certificate course on Coursera. In this project Sckit learn’s KMeans clustering algorithm has been used to cluster more than 1000 African cities on their location, population, density, surface, built-up area and their popular avenues. Then, we will look at each cluster to find out which cluster offers most diverse characteristics so that we could choose a city of that cluster as our future summer vacation destination.
