    "Africa is one of the most largest continents in the world. Despites of being one of the poorest continents of the world, it is still the most unique of them all. Whenever Africa is mentioned,  most people think of roaming animals and jeep safaris. Whilst Africa has much more to offer than animals, the beauty that nature has bestowed on this continent cannot be overlooked. The animal inhabitants of Africa are amongst the most varied and beautiful in the world. \n",
